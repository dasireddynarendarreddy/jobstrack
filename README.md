## ü§ñ AI Tool Used ‚Äì ChatGPT (GPT-4 by OpenAI)

During the development of this project, I utilized **ChatGPT (GPT-4)** by **OpenAI** as a virtual coding assistant to streamline the fullstack development process. The AI tool provided valuable support in writing, refactoring, debugging, and organizing the codebase effectively.

### üöÄ How ChatGPT Assisted:

- üîß **React & Component Design**: Helped plan and structure React components like `JobForm`, `JobCard`, and `FilterBar` efficiently.
- üé® **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Suggested responsive, accessible Tailwind class combinations that ensured a polished UI across devices.
- üêõ **Bug Fixes & Debugging**: Guided through solving common frontend-backend integration issues such as:
  - CORS errors
  - Axios API mismatches
  - MongoDB connection/auth errors
- üåê **Express + MongoDB Setup**: Supported backend structure with:
  - Route organization
  - Mongoose model creation
  - Connecting to MongoDB Atlas
- üìä **DSA Problem Solving**: Explained logic and provided clean, testable solutions for the given algorithm questions.
- üí° **Best Practices**: Shared performance tips and readability improvements for React state, REST API calls, and backend logic.

### üß† Why Use ChatGPT?

ChatGPT helped:
- Speed up the development cycle
- Offer alternate solutions during blockers
- Enhance understanding of new libraries (e.g., shadcn/ui)
- Provide just-in-time documentation and examples
